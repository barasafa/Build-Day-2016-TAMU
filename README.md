The College of Architecture Diversity Council, partnering with the Center for the Study of Digital Libraries, will hold a 24 hour challenge for interdisciplinary teams to create and publish visualisations using Texas A&M Universityâ€™s publicly available data. We are excited to take part in the worldwide efforts to liberate data.

**What**:  B/CS Diversity Open Data BuildDay is a 24 hour interdisciplinary competition to address challenges posed by civic groups, student organizations and city representatives dedicated to social justice. The event will provide a platform for critical discussion of 'diversity' and 'inclusivity' of Texas A&M and the wider Bryan / College Station area. 

**Who**:  Students, faculty and staff from all backgrounds and disciplines are welcome. Teams up to 5 people.

**When**:  February 05-06 2016: Friday 5pm - Saturday 5pm.  Registration starts at 4pm - please come early to get set. 

**Where**:  Langford Building A (Kick Off in Geren Auditorium, Langford Building B)

**Why**:  Your ideas will be exposed to city representatives, expert mentors from various departments and local businesses. In addition to addressing some of the most pressing issues in the B/CS community, you will also compete for the total of $5000 in prize money.

Best response to each of the six Challenges will receive **$500** per team. All teams will compete for additional $2000 to be awarded in several categories (TBC at the Kick off): such as most daring, critical, creative, engaging and practical.

Come and meet new people, expand your skillset and have some FUN!

We will have a team of DJs for the duration of the event, free food and snacks, free use of woodshop, laser cutters, 3D printer and $50 per team to purchase material to be used for projects.
